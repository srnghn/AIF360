# AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) R Package 

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

The AI Fairness 360 toolkit is an open-source library to help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. 
The AI Fairness 360 R package includes a comprehensive set of metrics for datasets and models to test for biases, explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models.

## Installation

This package is currently under [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) review.

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IBM/AIF360/aif360/aif360-r") 
```

Then, use the install_aif360() function to install AIF360:

``` r
library(aif360)
install_aif360()
``` 

## Getting Started

``` r
load_aif360_lib()
``` 

``` r
# load a toy dataset
data <- data.frame("feature1" = c(0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0), 
                   "feature2" = c(0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1),
+                  "label" = c(1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1))
# format the dataset
formatted_dataset <- aif360::aif_dataset(data_path = data, 
                                          favor_label = 0, 
                                          unfavor_label = 1, 
                                          unprivileged_protected_attribute = 0, 
                                          privileged_protected_attribute = 1, 
                                          target_column = "label", 
                                          protected_attribute = "feature1")

```
